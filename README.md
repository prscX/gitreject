# A collection of `.gitignore` templates

This is MetricStream Mobility Labs collection of [`.gitignore`][man] file templates.
We use this list to populate the `.gitignore` template choosers available
in the mobility interface when creating new repositories and files.

For more information about how `.gitignore` files work, and how to use them,
the following resources are a great place to start:

- The [Ignoring Files chapter][chapter] of the [Pro Git][progit] book.
- The [Ignoring Files article] on the GitLab Help site.
- The [gitignore(5)][man] manual page.

[man]: http://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore
[chapter]: http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Basics-Recording-Changes-to-the-Repository#Ignoring-Files
[progit]: http://git-scm.com/book

## Folder structure

The files in the root directory are for `.gitignore` templates that are
project specific, such as language or framework specific templates.
Global (operating system or editor specific) templates should go into the
[`Global/`](./Global) directory.
